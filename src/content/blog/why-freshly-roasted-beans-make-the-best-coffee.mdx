Ever wondered why that expensive bag of coffee sometimes tastes flat? The answer is simple: **Freshness.** Coffee is a perishable product, and from the moment the beans leave the roaster, the clock starts ticking.

## The Degassing Process

After roasting, coffee beans release carbon dioxide in a process called degassing. If you brew beans that are too fresh (less than 24 hours), the gas can block water from extracting the flavor. However, after 7 to 14 days, the beans reach their "peak flavor."

### How to Check for Freshness

* **The Roast Date:** Always look for a specific date, not a "Best Before" date.
* **The Valve Test:** That little hole on the bag isn't for smelling; it's a one-way valve to let gas out without letting oxygen in.
* **Oily Surface:** For medium to dark roasts, a slight sheen of oil indicates freshness.

## Essential Gear for Fresh Coffee

To keep your beans fresh, you need a proper airtight container and a reliable grinder. Grinding right before brewing is the single best way to improve your coffee quality.
