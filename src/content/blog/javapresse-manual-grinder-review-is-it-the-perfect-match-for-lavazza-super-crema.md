## Why This Pair Works: JavaPresse + Lavazza Super Crema

**Lavazza Super Crema** is known for its balanced, slightly sweet profile with notes of hazelnut and brown sugar. To get the best out of it, you need a **consistent, even grind**.

* **Precision via Click Settings:** JavaPresse offers over 18 settings. For Lavazza beans brewed via Pour Over or Aeropress, finding that "sweet spot" medium grind is crucial to avoid under-extraction.
* **Superior Ceramic Burrs:** Unlike blade grinders that "chop" beans, the ceramic burrs in the JavaPresse mill them consistently. This ensures uniform particle size for optimal flavor extraction.
* **Maximum Freshness:** By grinding your Lavazza beans right before brewing, you preserve the volatile aromas that make coffee special.

> **Zaidly's Pro Tip:** For Lavazza Super Crema brewed on a V60, we recommend a setting of **8-10 clicks** on your JavaPresse.
