\# Comprehensive Basic SEO Guide for the Astro Blogger

Welcome! You've already chosen the blazing-fast Astro framework, which is an excellent foundation for SEO. Now, let's focus on content and structure.

\## Why SEO Matters with Astro's Speed

Astro makes your site extremely fast, and speed is a \*\*major ranking factor\*\* on Google. However, without a good content SEO [strategy,](http://localhost:4321/) your fast site might not be discovered.

\### 🎯 Keyword-Driven Content Strategy

Every article should have a focus:

1. \*\*Choose One Main Keyword:\*\* For example, if this article is about Decap CMS, use a phrase like "\*\*Astro Decap CMS setup\*\*" naturally in your:

\* Title (as we have done).

\* First paragraph.

\* Sub-headings (H2 and H3).

2. \*\*Create In-Depth Content:\*\* Google favors comprehensive content. Don't be afraid to write longer pieces, provided they are informative.
3. \*\*Improve Readability:\*\* Use short paragraphs, lists, and headings to make the structure easy to understand for both readers and Google's crawlers.

\## Simple Structure and Technical SEO

\### 🔗 Internal and External Linking

\* \*\*Internal Links:\** Always link to other relevant articles on your own blog. This helps Google navigate and understand the overall authority of your site.

\* \*\*External Links:\** Link out to authoritative sources (like the official Astro documentation or Decap CMS GitHub) to build credibility.

\### 🖼️ Image Optimization (Future Step)

If you upload images later, make sure you fill in the \*\*Alt Text\*\* that describes the image contents accurately.

\> \*\*Mandatory Task:\*\* After publishing, ensure the article's \*slug\* (URL) is concise, such as: \`/basic-seo-for-astro-blog\`.
